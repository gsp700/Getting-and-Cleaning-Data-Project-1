# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Project-1
  
First step is to get data for analysis. For this the UCI HAR Dataset must be extracted and..
the UCI HAR Dataset was made availble in a directory called "UCI HAR Dataset"

In the second step, the test and training sets were merged together using script run_analysis.

In the third step, labels are added and only columns that have to do with mean and standard deviation are kept.

In the fourth step, the script will create a tidy data set containing the means of all the columns per test subject and per activity. 

This tidy dataset will be written to a tab-delimited file called tidy.txt.
